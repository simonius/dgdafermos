This folder contains a DG solver on unstructured triangular grids.
A entropy dissipation mechanism based on positive integral operators is steered
by an estimate of the maximal possible dissipation speed.
Therefore, the entropy rate criterion is enforced in an approximate regime.
A documentation of the possible make targets can be found in the Makefile.
The only external library needed is HDF5 to export the solution.

Compiling one of the possible make targets produces an executable for a particular testcase.
If called it will produce two hdf5 files in the folder output/, one corresponding to the grid used.
The second one holds the conserved variables at simulation end.

If these two files are available corresponding python scripts produce figures for the
publication in the folder figures/. 
If the testfile needs a grid one can find these in the subfolder grids/.
